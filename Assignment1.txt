Assignment 1
Due: Sept 15

Using Matlab: program the steepest descent method for any arbitrary two dimensional problem. 
Graphical representation of the optimization process is required. 
Upload a clearly commented Matlab file. 
Have Matlab create a plot giving the objective function value w.r.t to the number of iterations. 
The code should automatically scale the variables. 
Using a quadratic function, use three types of "line" searches: 
1. arbitrary step value
2. exact line search using fminbnd function
3. exact line search using analytical expression for quadratic problems derived in class.
