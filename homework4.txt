xProgram SLP with Matlab for any arbitrary problem with n dimensions. 
xUse an already made linear programming package.
xUse finite differences for the sensitivities. 
xBy default, use constant move limits. 
For 2D problems, represent graphically the linearized constraints and objective. 
xDepict the evolution of the iterate. 
Generate plots giving the objective function and the constraints violation w.r.t to the number iterations. 
xFind the Lagrange multipliers at the optimum. 

Provide a report with explanations and the results for an example with at least two nonlinear constraints (such as the one in the notes). 
Upload commented Matlab file.
