Homework 8

xWith Matlab: create a radial basis function metamodel for any arbitrary  function of 2 variables. 
xUse lhsdesign to create the design of experiments. 
Find the optimal radial basis parameter "c" using:
   leave-one-out cross validation
   4-fold cross validation. 
For a function of your choice: plot the actual function, the approximated function, and give the R2 and RMAE on a set of points not used to build the RBF approximation.

Redo HW 8 on RBF. Add an optimization where the surrogate is updated iteratively as seen in class. Extra credit (10 points): implement a trust region scheme.
